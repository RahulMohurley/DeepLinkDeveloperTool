Welcome to DeepLink, a tool for Android developers. The Android OS has been carefully built to support linking among apps using a feature called "intent filters." Users can build their apps and add functionality to them so that they may generate links containing information about certain activities, data, etc. These links may then be opened directly in the app when clicked if the app's manifest file has been configured accordingly. Using this tool, developers can inject their projects with deep link generation and support.

This tool will provide the general framework for a user to inject deep linking into their application. By targeting the app's AndroidManifest.xml and injecting a "BROWSABLE" intent filter as well as providing a general framework for how to generate and extract intents, a developer will have the necessary structure and configurations to support deep linking.

This tool is being built as part of the Software Systems Laboratory at Columbia University. I am under the supervision of PhD candidate Yang Tang and Professor Junfeng Yang.
